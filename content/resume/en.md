Hello! My name is Jung Sung-woo .

I am a developer who aspires to be self-motivated and to inspire others through my work. 

My passion lies in creating architectures that simplify the development process for others, and fostering a developmental culture that encourages growth.

In my free time, I enjoy Korean indie music and lo-fi tracks, and I have a penchant for playing the ukulele ðŸª•
